Repository Path: {repo_path}

Generate all necessary diagrams to visually represent this system. Include the following types of diagrams where applicable:

### System Architecture Diagram
Create a high-level architecture diagram showing:
- Major components/modules and their relationships
- External dependencies and integrations
- Data flow between components
- Use Mermaid flowchart or C4 diagram syntax

### Component/Module Diagram
Show the internal structure:
- Individual modules/packages/namespaces
- Dependencies between modules
- Public interfaces and APIs
- Use Mermaid flowchart or graph syntax

### Data Flow Diagram
Illustrate how data moves through the system:
- Data sources and destinations
- Processing steps
- Transformations and validations
- Use Mermaid flowchart syntax

### API Flow Diagram (if applicable)
For web services and APIs:
- Request/response flows
- Authentication/authorization steps
- Error handling paths
- Use Mermaid sequence diagram syntax

### Database Schema Diagram (if applicable)
If database models are present:
- Entity relationships
- Key constraints
- Table structures
- Use Mermaid ER diagram syntax

### Deployment Architecture (if applicable)
Show deployment structure:
- Infrastructure components
- Service distribution
- Network connections
- Use Mermaid flowchart syntax

### Sequence Diagrams for Key Processes
For important workflows:
- User authentication flow
- Main business process flows
- Error handling sequences
- Use Mermaid sequence diagram syntax

### Class Relationships (if applicable)
For object-oriented codebases:
- Class hierarchies
- Interface implementations
- Key relationships
- Use Mermaid class diagram syntax

### Instructions:
- Format the output as a markdown document with proper headings and code blocks. 
- Use proper Mermaid syntax for all diagrams
- EQuote ALL mermaid keys to ensure no parse errors are present
    CORRECT: Ext_Cloud["Cloud Storage (GCS)"]
    INCORRECT (will fail to render): Ext_Cloud[Cloud Storage (GCS)]
- Include descriptive titles and labels
- Add comments explaining complex relationships
- Group related diagrams under appropriate sections
- If a diagram type doesn't apply to this codebase, explain why and skip it
- Focus on the most important and revealing diagrams for understanding the system
- Use consistent naming conventions across all diagrams
- Include legend/key where helpful for understanding symbols

For each diagram, provide:
1. A brief description of what the diagram shows
2. The Mermaid code block
3. Any important notes or explanations about the relationships shown
